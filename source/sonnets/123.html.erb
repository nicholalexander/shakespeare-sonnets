      No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,<br>
      
      Thy pyramids built up with newer might<br>
      
      To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,<br>
      
      They are but dressings Of a former sight:<br>
      
      Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,<br>
      
      What thou dost foist upon us that is old,<br>
      
      And rather make them born to our desire,<br>
      
      Than think that we before have heard them told:<br>
      
      Thy registers and thee I both defy,<br>
      
      Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,<br>
      
      For thy records, and what we see doth lie,<br>
      
      Made more or less by thy continual haste:<br>
      
      This I do vow and this shall ever be,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">This I do vow and this shall ever be,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.</span><br>
