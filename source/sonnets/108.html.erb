      What's in the brain that ink may character,<br>
      
      Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,<br>
      
      What's new to speak, what now to register,<br>
      
      That may express my love, or thy dear merit?<br>
      
      Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,<br>
      
      I must each day say o'er the very same,<br>
      
      Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<br>
      
      Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.<br>
      
      So that eternal love in love's fresh case,<br>
      
      Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<br>
      
      Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<br>
      
      But makes antiquity for aye his page,<br>
      
      Finding the first conceit of love there bred,<br>
