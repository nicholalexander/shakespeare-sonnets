        Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
      
        Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
      
        Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
      
        Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
      
        And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
      
        Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
      
        But these particulars are not my measure,
      
        All these I better in one general best.
      
        Thy love is better than high birth to me,
      
        Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
      
        Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
      
        And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
      
        Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
      
        All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
