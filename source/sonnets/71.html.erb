        No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
      
        Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
      
        Give warning to the world that I am fled
      
        From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
      
        Nay if you read this line, remember not,
      
        The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
      
        That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
      
        If thinking on me then should make you woe.
      
        O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
      
        When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
      
        Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
      
        But let your love even with my life decay.
      
        Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
      
        And mock you with me after I am gone.
