      Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<br>
      
      When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<br>
      
      Before these bastard signs of fair were born,<br>
      
      Or durst inhabit on a living brow:<br>
      
      Before the golden tresses of the dead,<br>
      
      The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<br>
      
      To live a second life on second head,<br>
      
      Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:<br>
      
      In him those holy antique hours are seen,<br>
      
      Without all ornament, it self and true,<br>
      
      Making no summer of another's green,<br>
      
      Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,<br>
      
      And him as for a map doth Nature store,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And him as for a map doth Nature store,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</span><br>
