        Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
      
        Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
      
        Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
      
        Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
      
        As on the finger of a throned queen,
      
        The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
      
        So are those errors that in thee are seen,
      
        To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
      
        How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
      
        If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
      
        How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
      
        if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
      
        But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
      
        As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
