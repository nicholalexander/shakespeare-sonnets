      Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,<br>
      
      Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,<br>
      
      O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,<br>
      
      And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,<br>
      
      Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,<br>
      
      That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,<br>
      
      And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,<br>
      
      Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.<br>
      
      Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,<br>
      
      Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,<br>
      
      Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,<br>
      
      Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<br>
      
      If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">By self-example mayst thou be denied.</span><br>
