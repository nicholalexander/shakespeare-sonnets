      PERFECT typography is more a science than an art. Mastery of the trade is
      indispensable, but it isn't everything. Unerring taste, the hallmark of
      perfection, rests also upon a clear understanding of the laws of harmonious
      design. As a rule, impeccable taste springs partly from inborn sensitivity:
      from feeling. But feelings remain rather unproductive unless they can inspire a
      secure judgment. Feelings have to mature into knowledge about the consequences
      of formal decisions. For this reason, there are no born masters of typography,
      but self- education may lead in time to mastery.
