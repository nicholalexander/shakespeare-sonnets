        From fairest creatures we desire increase,
      
        That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
      
        But as the riper should by time decease,
      
        His tender heir might bear his memory:
      
        But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
      
        Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
      
        Making a famine where abundance lies,
      
        Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
      
        Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
      
        And only herald to the gaudy spring,
      
        Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
      
        And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
      
        Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      
        To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
