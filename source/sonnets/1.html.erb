      From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
      
      That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
      
      But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
      
      His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
      
      But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
      
      Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
      
      Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
      
      Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
      
      Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br>
      
      And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
      
      Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
      
      And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</span><br>
