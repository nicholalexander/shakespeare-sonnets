      So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<br>
      
      Like a deceived husband, so love's face,<br>
      
      May still seem love to me, though altered new:<br>
      
      Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.<br>
      
      For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<br>
      
      Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,<br>
      
      In many's looks, the false heart's history<br>
      
      Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.<br>
      
      But heaven in thy creation did decree,<br>
      
      That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,<br>
      
      Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,<br>
      
      Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.<br>
      
      How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.</span><br>
