      But do thy worst to steal thy self away,<br>
      
      For term of life thou art assured mine,<br>
      
      And life no longer than thy love will stay,<br>
      
      For it depends upon that love of thine.<br>
      
      Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<br>
      
      When in the least of them my life hath end,<br>
      
      I see, a better state to me belongs<br>
      
      Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.<br>
      
      Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<br>
      
      Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,<br>
      
      O what a happy title do I find,<br>
      
      Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<br>
