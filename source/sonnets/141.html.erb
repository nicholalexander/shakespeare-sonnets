      In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,<br>
      
      For they in thee a thousand errors note,<br>
      
      But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,<br>
      
      Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.<br>
      
      Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,<br>
      
      Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,<br>
      
      Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<br>
      
      To any sensual feast with thee alone:<br>
      
      But my five wits, nor my five senses can<br>
      
      Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<br>
      
      Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,<br>
      
      Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.</span><br>
