      Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?<br>
      
      Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,<br>
      
      And that your love taught it this alchemy?<br>
      
      To make of monsters, and things indigest,<br>
      
      Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,<br>
      
      Creating every bad a perfect best<br>
      
      As fast as objects to his beams assemble:<br>
      
      O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,<br>
      
      And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,<br>
      
      Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,<br>
      
      And to his palate doth prepare the cup.<br>
      
      If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</span><br>
