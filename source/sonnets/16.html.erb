      But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br>
      
      Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?<br>
      
      And fortify your self in your decay<br>
      
      With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br>
      
      Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
      
      And many maiden gardens yet unset,<br>
      
      With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br>
      
      Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br>
      
      So should the lines of life that life repair<br>
      
      Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen<br>
      
      Neither in inward worth nor outward fair<br>
      
      Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br>
      
      To give away your self, keeps your self still,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">To give away your self, keeps your self still,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</span><br>
