        That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
      
        And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
      
        That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
      
        A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
      
        Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
      
        Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
      
        And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
      
        Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
      
        If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
      
        And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
      
        Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
      
        And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
      
        But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
      
        Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
