      That thou hast her it is not all my grief,<br>
      
      And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,<br>
      
      That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,<br>
      
      A loss in love that touches me more nearly.<br>
      
      Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,<br>
      
      Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,<br>
      
      And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<br>
      
      Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.<br>
      
      If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,<br>
      
      And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,<br>
      
      Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<br>
      
      And both for my sake lay on me this cross,<br>
      
      But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.</span><br>
