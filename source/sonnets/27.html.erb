        Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
      
        The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
      
        But then begins a journey in my head
      
        To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
      
        For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
      
        Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
      
        And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
      
        Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
      
        Save that my soul's imaginary sight
      
        Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
      
        Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
      
        Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
      
        Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
      
        For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
