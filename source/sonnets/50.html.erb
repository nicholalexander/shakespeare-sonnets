      How heavy do I journey on the way,<br>
      
      When what I seek (my weary travel's end)<br>
      
      Doth teach that case and that repose to say<br>
      
      'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'<br>
      
      The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br>
      
      Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br>
      
      As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br>
      
      His rider loved not speed being made from thee:<br>
      
      The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br>
      
      That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br>
      
      Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br>
      
      More sharp to me than spurring to his side,<br>
      
      For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">For that same groan doth put this in my mind,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">My grief lies onward and my joy behind.</span><br>
