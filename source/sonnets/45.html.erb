      The other two, slight air, and purging fire,<br>
      
      Are both with thee, wherever I abide,<br>
      
      The first my thought, the other my desire,<br>
      
      These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br>
      
      For when these quicker elements are gone<br>
      
      In tender embassy of love to thee,<br>
      
      My life being made of four, with two alone,<br>
      
      Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.<br>
      
      Until life's composition be recured,<br>
      
      By those swift messengers returned from thee,<br>
      
      Who even but now come back again assured,<br>
      
      Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.<br>
      
      This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,<br>
