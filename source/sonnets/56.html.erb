        Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
      
        Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
      
        Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
      
        To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
      
        So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
      
        Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
      
        To-morrow see again, and do not kill
      
        The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
      
        Let this sad interim like the ocean be
      
        Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
      
        Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
      
        Return of love, more blest may be the view.
      
        Or call it winter, which being full of care,
      
        Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
