      O lest the world should task you to recite,<br>
      
      What merit lived in me that you should love<br>
      
      After my death (dear love) forget me quite,<br>
      
      For you in me can nothing worthy prove.<br>
      
      Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<br>
      
      To do more for me than mine own desert,<br>
      
      And hang more praise upon deceased I,<br>
      
      Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<br>
      
      O lest your true love may seem false in this,<br>
      
      That you for love speak well of me untrue,<br>
      
      My name be buried where my body is,<br>
      
      And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.<br>
      
      For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And so should you, to love things nothing worth.</span><br>
