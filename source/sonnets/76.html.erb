      Why is my verse so barren of new pride?<br>
      
      So far from variation or quick change?<br>
      
      Why with the time do I not glance aside<br>
      
      To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?<br>
      
      Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br>
      
      And keep invention in a noted weed,<br>
      
      That every word doth almost tell my name,<br>
      
      Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?<br>
      
      O know sweet love I always write of you,<br>
      
      And you and love are still my argument:<br>
      
      So all my best is dressing old words new,<br>
      
      Spending again what is already spent:<br>
      
      For as the sun is daily new and old,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">For as the sun is daily new and old,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">So is my love still telling what is told.</span><br>
