        Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
      
        So far from variation or quick change?
      
        Why with the time do I not glance aside
      
        To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
      
        Why write I still all one, ever the same,
      
        And keep invention in a noted weed,
      
        That every word doth almost tell my name,
      
        Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
      
        O know sweet love I always write of you,
      
        And you and love are still my argument:
      
        So all my best is dressing old words new,
      
        Spending again what is already spent:
      
        For as the sun is daily new and old,
      
        So is my love still telling what is told.
