      O that you were your self, but love you are<br>
      
      No longer yours, than you your self here live,<br>
      
      Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
      
      And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br>
      
      So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
      
      Find no determination, then you were<br>
      
      Your self again after your self's decease,<br>
      
      When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br>
      
      Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
      
      Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br>
      
      Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<br>
      
      And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<br>
      
      O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">You had a father, let your son say so.</span><br>
