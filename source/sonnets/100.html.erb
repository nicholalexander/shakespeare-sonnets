      Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,<br>
      
      To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br>
      
      Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br>
      
      Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br>
      
      Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,<br>
      
      In gentle numbers time so idly spent,<br>
      
      Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,<br>
      
      And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<br>
      
      Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,<br>
      
      If time have any wrinkle graven there,<br>
      
      If any, be a satire to decay,<br>
      
      And make time's spoils despised everywhere.<br>
      
      Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.</span><br>
