      Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,<br>
      
      My sinful earth these rebel powers array,<br>
      
      Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth<br>
      
      Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br>
      
      Why so large cost having so short a lease,<br>
      
      Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br>
      
      Shall worms inheritors of this excess<br>
      
      Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?<br>
      
      Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,<br>
      
      And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br>
      
      Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br>
      
      Within be fed, without be rich no more,<br>
      
      So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And death once dead, there's no more dying then.</span><br>
