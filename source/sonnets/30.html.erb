        When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
      
        I summon up remembrance of things past,
      
        I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
      
        And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
      
        Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
      
        For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
      
        And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
      
        And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
      
        Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
      
        And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
      
        The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
      
        Which I new pay as if not paid before.
      
        But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
      
        All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
