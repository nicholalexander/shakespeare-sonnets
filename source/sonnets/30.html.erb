      When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,<br>
      
      I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
      
      I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
      
      And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<br>
      
      Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)<br>
      
      For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<br>
      
      And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,<br>
      
      And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.<br>
      
      Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
      
      And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<br>
      
      The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br>
      
      Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br>
      
      But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)<br>
