        Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
      
        One of her feathered creatures broke away,
      
        Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
      
        In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
      
        Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
      
        Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
      
        To follow that which flies before her face:
      
        Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
      
        So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,
      
        Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
      
        But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
      
        And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
      
        So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
      
        If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
