      Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,<br>
      
      One of her feathered creatures broke away,<br>
      
      Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch<br>
      
      In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:<br>
      
      Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<br>
      
      Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,<br>
      
      To follow that which flies before her face:<br>
      
      Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;<br>
      
      So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,<br>
      
      Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,<br>
      
      But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:<br>
      
      And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">If thou turn back and my loud crying still.</span><br>
