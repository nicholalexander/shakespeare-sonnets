      Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,<br>
      
      Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,<br>
      
      My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,<br>
      
      And perspective it is best painter's art.<br>
      
      For through the painter must you see his skill,<br>
      
      To find where your true image pictured lies,<br>
      
      Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<br>
      
      That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:<br>
      
      Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,<br>
      
      Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br>
      
      Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br>
      
      Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br>
      
      Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</span><br>
