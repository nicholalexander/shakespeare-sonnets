        My love is as a fever longing still,
      
        For that which longer nurseth the disease,
      
        Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
      
        Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
      
        My reason the physician to my love,
      
        Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
      
        Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
      
        Desire is death, which physic did except.
      
        Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
      
        And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
      
        My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
      
        At random from the truth vainly expressed.
      
        For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
      
        Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
