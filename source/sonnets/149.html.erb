        Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
      
        When I against my self with thee partake?
      
        Do I not think on thee when I forgot
      
        Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
      
        Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
      
        On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
      
        Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
      
        Revenge upon my self with present moan?
      
        What merit do I in my self respect,
      
        That is so proud thy service to despise,
      
        When all my best doth worship thy defect,
      
        Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
      
        But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
      
        Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
