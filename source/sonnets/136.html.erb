      Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.<br>
      
      'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<br>
      
      Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,<br>
      
      In things of great receipt with case we prove,<br>
      
      Among a number one is reckoned none.<br>
