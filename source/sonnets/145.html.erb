      Those lips that Love's own hand did make,<br>
      
      Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',<br>
      
      To me that languished for her sake:<br>
      
      But when she saw my woeful state,<br>
      
      Straight in her heart did mercy come,<br>
      
      Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,<br>
      
      Was used in giving gentle doom:<br>
      
      And taught it thus anew to greet:<br>
      
      'I hate' she altered with an end,<br>
      
      That followed it as gentle day,<br>
      
      Doth follow night who like a fiend<br>
      
      From heaven to hell is flown away.<br>
      
      'I hate', from hate away she threw,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">'I hate', from hate away she threw,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And saved my life saying 'not you'.</span><br>
