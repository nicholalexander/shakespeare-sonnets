        In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
      
        But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
      
        In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
      
        In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
      
        But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
      
        When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
      
        For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
      
        And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
      
        For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
      
        Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
      
        And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
      
        Or made them swear against the thing they see.
      
        For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
      
        To swear against the truth so foul a be.
