      In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,<br>
      
      But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,<br>
      
      In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,<br>
      
      In vowing new hate after new love bearing:<br>
      
      But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,<br>
      
      When I break twenty? I am perjured most,<br>
      
      For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:<br>
      
      And all my honest faith in thee is lost.<br>
      
      For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:<br>
      
      Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,<br>
      
      And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,<br>
      
      Or made them swear against the thing they see.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">To swear against the truth so foul a be.</span><br>
