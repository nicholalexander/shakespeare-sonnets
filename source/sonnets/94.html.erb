      They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,<br>
      
      And husband nature's riches from expense,<br>
      
      Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,<br>
      
      Others, but stewards of their excellence:<br>
      
      The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,<br>
      
      Though to it self, it only live and die,<br>
      
      But if that flower with base infection meet,<br>
      
      The basest weed outbraves his dignity:<br>
      
      For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</span><br>
