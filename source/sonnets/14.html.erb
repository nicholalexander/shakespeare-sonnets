        Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
      
        And yet methinks I have astronomy,
      
        But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
      
        Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
      
        Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
      
        Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
      
        Or say with princes if it shall go well
      
        By oft predict that I in heaven find.
      
        But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
      
        And constant stars in them I read such art
      
        As truth and beauty shall together thrive
      
        If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
      
        Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
      
        Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
