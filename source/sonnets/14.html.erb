      Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,<br>
      
      And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br>
      
      But not to tell of good, or evil luck,<br>
      
      Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,<br>
      
      Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;<br>
      
      Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
      
      Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
      
      By oft predict that I in heaven find.<br>
      
      But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
      
      And constant stars in them I read such art<br>
      
      As truth and beauty shall together thrive<br>
      
      If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:<br>
      
      Or else of thee this I prognosticate,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.</span><br>
