      Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br>
      
      Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,<br>
      
      But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br>
      
      Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.<br>
      
      When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
      
      And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
      
      Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:<br>
      
      The living record of your memory.<br>
      
      'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity<br>
      
      Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,<br>
      
      Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
      
      That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">So till the judgment that your self arise,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</span><br>
