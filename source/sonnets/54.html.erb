      O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,<br>
      
      By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!<br>
      
      The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>
      
      For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:<br>
      
      The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,<br>
      
      As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<br>
      
      Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,<br>
      
      When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:<br>
      
      But for their virtue only is their show,<br>
      
      They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,<br>
      
      Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,<br>
      
      Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.</span><br>
