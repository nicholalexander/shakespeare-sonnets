      Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,<br>
      
      Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,<br>
      
      Can yet the lease of my true love control,<br>
      
      Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.<br>
      
      The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,<br>
      
      And the sad augurs mock their own presage,<br>
      
      Incertainties now crown themselves assured,<br>
      
      And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br>
      
      Now with the drops of this most balmy time,<br>
      
      My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,<br>
      
      Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,<br>
      
      While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.<br>
      
      And thou in this shalt find thy monument,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</span><br>
