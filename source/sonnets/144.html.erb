      Two loves I have of comfort and despair,<br>
      
      Which like two spirits do suggest me still,<br>
      
      The better angel is a man right fair:<br>
      
      The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.<br>
      
      To win me soon to hell my female evil,<br>
      
      Tempteth my better angel from my side,<br>
      
      And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:<br>
      
      Wooing his purity with her foul pride.<br>
      
      And whether that my angel be turned fiend,<br>
      
      Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,<br>
      
      But being both from me both to each friend,<br>
      
      I guess one angel in another's hell.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</span><br>
