      As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br>
      
      Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br>
      
      Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br>
      
      Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;<br>
      
      So I for fear of trust, forget to say,<br>
      
      The perfect ceremony of love's rite,<br>
      
      And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,<br>
      
      O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:<br>
      
      O let my looks be then the eloquence,<br>
      
      And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br>
      
      Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br>
      
      More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.<br>
      
      O learn to read what silent love hath writ,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">O learn to read what silent love hath writ,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</span><br>
