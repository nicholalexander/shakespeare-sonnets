      O how thy worth with manners may I sing,<br>
      
      When thou art all the better part of me?<br>
      
      What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:<br>
      
      And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?<br>
      
      Even for this, let us divided live,<br>
      
      And our dear love lose name of single one,<br>
      
      That by this separation I may give:<br>
      
      That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:<br>
      
      O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,<br>
      
      Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,<br>
      
      To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<br>
      
      Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.<br>
      
      And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And that thou teachest how to make one twain,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">By praising him here who doth hence remain.</span><br>
