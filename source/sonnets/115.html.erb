      Those lines that I before have writ do lie,<br>
      
      Even those that said I could not love you dearer,<br>
      
      Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,<br>
      
      My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,<br>
      
      But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents<br>
      
      Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,<br>
      
      Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,<br>
      
      Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:<br>
      
      Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,<br>
      
      Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'<br>
      
      When I was certain o'er incertainty,<br>
      
      Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?<br>
      
      Love is a babe, then might I not say so<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Love is a babe, then might I not say so</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">To give full growth to that which still doth grow.</span><br>
