        The little Love-god lying once asleep,
      
        Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
      
        Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
      
        Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
      
        The fairest votary took up that fire,
      
        Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
      
        And so the general of hot desire,
      
        Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
      
        This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
      
        Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
      
        Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
      
        For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
      
        Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
      
        Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
