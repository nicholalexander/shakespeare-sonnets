      If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<br>
      
      Injurious distance should not stop my way,<br>
      
      For then despite of space I would be brought,<br>
      
      From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,<br>
      
      No matter then although my foot did stand<br>
      
      Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,<br>
      
      For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,<br>
      
      As soon as think the place where he would be.<br>
      
      But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought<br>
      
      To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<br>
      
      But that so much of earth and water wrought,<br>
      
      I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.<br>
      
      Receiving nought by elements so slow,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Receiving nought by elements so slow,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.</span><br>
