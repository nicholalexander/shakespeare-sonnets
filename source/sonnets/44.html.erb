        If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
      
        Injurious distance should not stop my way,
      
        For then despite of space I would be brought,
      
        From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
      
        No matter then although my foot did stand
      
        Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
      
        For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
      
        As soon as think the place where he would be.
      
        But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
      
        To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
      
        But that so much of earth and water wrought,
      
        I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.
      
        Receiving nought by elements so slow,
      
        But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
