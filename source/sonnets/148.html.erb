      O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,<br>
      
      Which have no correspondence with true sight,<br>
      
      Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,<br>
      
      That censures falsely what they see aright?<br>
      
      If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,<br>
      
      What means the world to say it is not so?<br>
      
      If it be not, then love doth well denote,<br>
      
      Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,<br>
      
      How can it? O how can love's eye be true,<br>
      
      That is so vexed with watching and with tears?<br>
      
      No marvel then though I mistake my view,<br>
      
      The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.</span><br>
