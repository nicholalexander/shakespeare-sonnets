        Against my love shall be as I am now
      
        With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
      
        When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
      
        With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
      
        Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
      
        And all those beauties whereof now he's king
      
        Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
      
        Stealing away the treasure of his spring:
      
        For such a time do I now fortify
      
        Against confounding age's cruel knife,
      
        That he shall never cut from memory
      
        My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
      
        His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
      
        And they shall live, and he in them still green.
