        Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
      
        Is lust in action, and till action, lust
      
        Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
      
        Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
      
        Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
      
        Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
      
        Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
      
        On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
      
        Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
      
        Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
      
        A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
      
        Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
      
        All this the world well knows yet none knows well,
      
        To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
