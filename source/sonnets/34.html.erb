      Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,<br>
      
      And make me travel forth without my cloak,<br>
      
      To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,<br>
      
      Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?<br>
      
      'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br>
      
      To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<br>
      
      For no man well of such a salve can speak,<br>
      
      That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:<br>
      
      Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,<br>
      
      Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,<br>
      
      Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief<br>
      
      To him that bears the strong offence's cross.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.</span><br>
