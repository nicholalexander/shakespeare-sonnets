      My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br>
      
      So long as youth and thou are of one date,<br>
      
      But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<br>
      
      Then look I death my days should expiate.<br>
      
      For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br>
      
      Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br>
      
      Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,<br>
      
      How can I then be elder than thou art?<br>
      
      O therefore love be of thyself so wary,<br>
      
      As I not for my self, but for thee will,<br>
      
      Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary<br>
      
      As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.</span><br>
