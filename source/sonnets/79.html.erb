        Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
      
        My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
      
        But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
      
        And my sick muse doth give an other place.
      
        I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
      
        Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
      
        Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
      
        He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
      
        He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
      
        From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
      
        And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
      
        No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
      
        Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
      
        Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
