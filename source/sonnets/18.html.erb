      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
      
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
      
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
      
      And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
      
      Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
      
      And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<br>
      
      And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
      
      By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:<br>
      
      But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
      
      Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br>
      
      Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
      
      When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br>
      
      So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</span><br>
