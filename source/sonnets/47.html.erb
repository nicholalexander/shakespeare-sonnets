        Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
      
        And each doth good turns now unto the other,
      
        When that mine eye is famished for a look,
      
        Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;
      
        With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
      
        And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
      
        Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
      
        And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
      
        So either by thy picture or my love,
      
        Thy self away, art present still with me,
      
        For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
      
        And I am still with them, and they with thee.
      
        Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
      
        Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
