      Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br>
      
      And each doth good turns now unto the other,<br>
      
      When that mine eye is famished for a look,<br>
      
      Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;<br>
      
      With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,<br>
      
      And to the painted banquet bids my heart:<br>
      
      Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,<br>
      
      And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.<br>
      
      So either by thy picture or my love,<br>
      
      Thy self away, art present still with me,<br>
      
      For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br>
      
      And I am still with them, and they with thee.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.</span><br>
