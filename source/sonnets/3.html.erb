        Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
      
        Now is the time that face should form another,
      
        Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
      
        Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
      
        For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
      
        Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
      
        Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
      
        Of his self-love to stop posterity?
      
        Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
      
        Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
      
        So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
      
        Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
      
        But if thou live remembered not to be,
      
        Die single and thine image dies with thee.
