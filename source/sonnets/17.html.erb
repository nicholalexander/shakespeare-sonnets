      Who will believe my verse in time to come<br>
      
      If it were filled with your most high deserts?<br>
      
      Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br>
      
      Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:<br>
      
      If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br>
      
      And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
      
      The age to come would say this poet lies,<br>
      
      Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.<br>
      
      So should my papers (yellowed with their age)<br>
      
      Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
      
      And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,<br>
      
      And stretched metre of an antique song.<br>
      
      But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">But were some child of yours alive that time,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.</span><br>
