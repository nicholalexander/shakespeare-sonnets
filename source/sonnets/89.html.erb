        Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
      
        And I will comment upon that offence,
      
        Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
      
        Against thy reasons making no defence.
      
        Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
      
        To set a form upon desired change,
      
        As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
      
        I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
      
        Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
      
        Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
      
        Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
      
        And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
      
        For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
      
        For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
