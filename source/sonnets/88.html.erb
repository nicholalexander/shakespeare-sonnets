      When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,<br>
      
      And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<br>
      
      Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,<br>
      
      And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:<br>
      
      With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<br>
      
      Upon thy part I can set down a story<br>
      
      Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:<br>
      
      That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:<br>
      
      And I by this will be a gainer too,<br>
      
      For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<br>
      
      The injuries that to my self I do,<br>
      
      Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.<br>
      
      Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.</span><br>
