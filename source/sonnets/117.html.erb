        Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
      
        Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
      
        Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
      
        Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
      
        That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
      
        And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
      
        That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
      
        Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
      
        Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
      
        And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
      
        Bring me within the level of your frown,
      
        But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
      
        Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
      
        The constancy and virtue of your love.
