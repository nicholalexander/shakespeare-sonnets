      When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,<br>
      
      For all the day they view things unrespected,<br>
      
      But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<br>
      
      And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.<br>
      
      Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright<br>
      
      How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,<br>
      
      To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br>
      
      When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<br>
      
      How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,<br>
      
      By looking on thee in the living day,<br>
      
      When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,<br>
      
      Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<br>
      
      All days are nights to see till I see thee,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">All days are nights to see till I see thee,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.</span><br>
