        Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
      
        Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
      
        Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
      
        Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
      
        If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
      
        By unions married do offend thine ear,
      
        They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
      
        In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:
      
        Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
      
        Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
      
        Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
      
        Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
      
        Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
      
        Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
