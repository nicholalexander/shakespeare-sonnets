      When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
      
      And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,<br>
      
      When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
      
      And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:<br>
      
      When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
      
      Which erst from heat did canopy the herd<br>
      
      And summer's green all girded up in sheaves<br>
      
      Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:<br>
      
      Then of thy beauty do I question make<br>
      
      That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
      
      Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,<br>
      
      And die as fast as they see others grow,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.</span><br>
