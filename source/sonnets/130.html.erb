        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
      
        Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
      
        If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
      
        If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
      
        I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
      
        But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
      
        And in some perfumes is there more delight,
      
        Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
      
        I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
      
        That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
      
        I grant I never saw a goddess go,
      
        My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
      
        And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
      
        As any she belied with false compare.
