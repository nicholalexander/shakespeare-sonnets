      My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,<br>
      
      Coral is far more red, than her lips red,<br>
      
      If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:<br>
      
      If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:<br>
      
      I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
      
      But no such roses see I in her cheeks,<br>
      
      And in some perfumes is there more delight,<br>
      
      Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
      
      I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,<br>
      
      That music hath a far more pleasing sound:<br>
      
      I grant I never saw a goddess go,<br>
      
      My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.<br>
      
      And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">As any she belied with false compare.</span><br>
