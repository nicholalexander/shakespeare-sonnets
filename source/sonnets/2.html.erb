      When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
      
      And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br>
      
      Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
      
      Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
      
      Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
      
      Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
      
      To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
      
      Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
      
      How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br>
      
      If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br>
      
      Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<br>
      
      Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">This were to be new made when thou art old,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</span><br>
