      My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,<br>
      
      While comments of your praise richly compiled,<br>
      
      Reserve their character with golden quill,<br>
      
      And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<br>
      
      I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,<br>
      
      And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,<br>
      
      To every hymn that able spirit affords,<br>
      
      In polished form of well refined pen.<br>
      
      Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,<br>
      
      And to the most of praise add something more,<br>
      
      But that is in my thought, whose love to you<br>
      
      (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,<br>
      
      Then others, for the breath of words respect,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Then others, for the breath of words respect,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</span><br>
