      When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,<br>
      
      I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
      
      And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
      
      And look upon my self and curse my fate,<br>
      
      Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
      
      Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br>
      
      Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,<br>
      
      With what I most enjoy contented least,<br>
      
      Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br>
      
      Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br>
      
      (Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
      
      From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</span><br>
