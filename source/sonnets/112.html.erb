        Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
      
        Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
      
        For what care I who calls me well or ill,
      
        So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
      
        You are my all the world, and I must strive,
      
        To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
      
        None else to me, nor I to none alive,
      
        That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
      
        In so profound abysm I throw all care
      
        Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
      
        To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
      
        Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
      
        You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
      
        That all the world besides methinks are dead.
