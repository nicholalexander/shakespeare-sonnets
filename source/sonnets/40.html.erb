        Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
      
        What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
      
        No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
      
        All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
      
        Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
      
        I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
      
        But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
      
        By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
      
        I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
      
        Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
      
        And yet love knows it is a greater grief
      
        To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
      
        Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
      
        Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
