        Being your slave what should I do but tend,
      
        Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
      
        I have no precious time at all to spend;
      
        Nor services to do till you require.
      
        Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
      
        Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
      
        Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
      
        When you have bid your servant once adieu.
      
        Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
      
        Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
      
        But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
      
        Save where you are, how happy you make those.
      
        So true a fool is love, that in your will,
      
        (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
