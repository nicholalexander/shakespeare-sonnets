      Being your slave what should I do but tend,<br>
      
      Upon the hours, and times of your desire?<br>
      
      I have no precious time at all to spend;<br>
      
      Nor services to do till you require.<br>
      
      Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,<br>
      
      Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,<br>
      
      Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,<br>
      
      When you have bid your servant once adieu.<br>
      
      Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,<br>
      
      Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<br>
      
      But like a sad slave stay and think of nought<br>
      
      Save where you are, how happy you make those.<br>
      
      So true a fool is love, that in your will,<br>
