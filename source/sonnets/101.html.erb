        O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
      
        For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
      
        Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
      
        So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
      
        Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
      
        'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
      
        Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
      
        But best is best, if never intermixed'?
      
        Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
      
        Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
      
        To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
      
        And to be praised of ages yet to be.
      
        Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
      
        To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
