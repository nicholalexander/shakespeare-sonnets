      Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,<br>
      
      That having such a scope to show her pride,<br>
      
      The argument all bare is of more worth<br>
      
      Than when it hath my added praise beside.<br>
      
      O blame me not if I no more can write!<br>
      
      Look in your glass and there appears a face,<br>
      
      That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<br>
      
      Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.<br>
      
      Were it not sinful then striving to mend,<br>
      
      To mar the subject that before was well?<br>
      
      For to no other pass my verses tend,<br>
      
      Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.<br>
      
      And more, much more than in my verse can sit,<br>
      
      <span class="pa4">And more, much more than in my verse can sit,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa4">Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.</span><br>
