      My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,<br>
      
      I love not less, though less the show appear,<br>
      
      That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,<br>
      
      The owner's tongue doth publish every where.<br>
      
      Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br>
      
      When I was wont to greet it with my lays,<br>
      
      As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,<br>
      
      And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:<br>
      
      Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br>
      
      Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br>
      
      But that wild music burthens every bough,<br>
      
      And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Because I would not dull you with my song.</span><br>
