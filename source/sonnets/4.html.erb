      Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
      
      Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br>
      
      Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
      
      And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
      
      Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
      
      The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
      
      Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
      
      So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
      
      For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
      
      Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
      
      Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
      
      What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
      
      Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</span><br>
      
      <span class="pa2">Which used lives th' executor to be.</span><br>
